#Create work.

== Opinion:

What Howard Shultz (CEO/Founder of Starbucks) is doing with Americans Helping Americans is a great idea. Giving consumers at Starbucks - and what's sure to be plenty of other storefronts in short order - the option to give $5 towards well selected & well managed small business loans is fantastic. 

But, traditional small businesses don't generally create new markets. They employ a very large number of people in the markets we already have, yet come up significantly short in dealing with our severe employment gap. The economic problems we face won't be solved by existing markets. It's the role of startups to innovate in existing markets and to create entirely new ones. Schultz's more traditional business focus doesn't fit the needs of more nimble web technology startups.

So what would a more startup-y version look like? Start with a digital payments layer (thinking of using Stripe) that established successful startups (with existing revenue streams) can integrate into their platforms to take in the same kind of "extra" payments Starbucks will be receiving. Then, grant or/and loan the money raise to new startups meeting a few key early stage criteria. Envision a variation a general crowdfunding model with emphasis on the startup validation process and selection platform. Backers get selection vouchers (votes) in exchange for their support (along with a bracelet, probably -- those things are incredibly low cost).
